* Notes
** simpler backend data structure
What if we only used 1 hash to hold all nodes and edges..., and what
if nodes could hold other nodes in their edge list, and edges could
hold other edges in their node list, what sort of structure would this
be?  A useful generalization of a graph?

** DONE min cut
Some notes in the stuff/ directory.
