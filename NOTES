* Notes
** simpler backend data structure
What if we only used 1 hash to hold all nodes and edges..., and what
if nodes could hold other nodes in their edge list, and edges could
hold other edges in their node list, what sort of structure would this
be?  A useful generalization of a graph?

* Tasks [1/7]
** DONE min cut
Some notes in the stuff/ directory.
** TODO breadth/depth first maps
** TODO minimum spanning tree
** TODO minimum edge coloring
** TODO clustering coefficient
the clustering coefficient
\begin{equation*}
  C = \frac{\text{number of closed connected triples}}{\text{number of connected triples}}
\end{equation*}

** TODO measure assortativity
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assortativity

Should take an optional :key function which defaults to node degree.

** TODO a random graph generator
