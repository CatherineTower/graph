 :abstract "The GRAPH library strives for simplicity both in
 backing data structures and in usage.  Graphs and Digraphs are
 represented as CLOS objects with methods and algorithms provided for
 graph manipulation and analysis.</p><p><em>Note</em>: currently this library
 is only supported on SBCL because of the need to create hashes with
 custom equality tests, however <em>many</em> other lisps support this
 so extending should be simple.  Patches welcome.")
