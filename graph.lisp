;; Graphs are composed of two hash tables, nodes and edges.
;;
;; node hash
;;  key -- node value
;;  val -- edge list
;;
;; edge hash
;;  key -- node list
;;  val -- edge value

;; What if we only used 1 hash to hold all nodes and edges..., and
;; what if nodes could hold other nodes in their edge list, and edges
;; could hold other edges in their node list, what sort of structure
;; would this be?  A useful generalization of a graph?
